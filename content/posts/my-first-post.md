I am commiting now to obtaining a degree in mechanical engineering within 5 years. I am doing this because I want to get a job working in a cutting edge space industry organization. I want to do this because I think space is cool and I want to challenge myself in a way that keeps my attention.

To accomplish these goals I will be first attending a 2 year college to keep my costs down, and completing projects throughout. While attending college I will work on specific engineering projects related to the job I want and documenting my progress here. The projects I hope to build include:
* A Thermal Vaccum Chamber
* A Reaction Wheel Attitude Control Demonstration
* A Robotic Arm
* A Cube Sat Payload
* An Asteroid Mining Simulation
* Simulate Asteroid Surface Operations

In addition to the projects I will also involve myself in organizations that can help me achieve my goals such as a Robotics Club, AIAA, RockSat, and CanSat.

I will try to find research to perform for at least 1 semester. and I will try to get internships at NASA, JPL, and/ or APL.

Skill I will master include Python, C/C++, ROS2, Cotrol Systems, CAD, FEA, GD+T, Thermal Modeling.
