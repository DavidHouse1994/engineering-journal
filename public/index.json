[{"content":"I am commiting now to obtaining a degree in mechanical engineering within 5 years. I am doing this because I want to get a job working in a cutting edge space industry organization. I want to do this because I think space is cool and I want to challenge myself in a way that keeps my attention.\nTo accomplish these goals I will be first attending a 2 year college to keep my costs down, and completing projects throughout. While attending college I will work on specific engineering projects related to the job I want and documenting my progress here. The projects I hope to build include:\nA Thermal Vaccum Chamber A Reaction Wheel Attitude Control Demonstration A Robotic Arm A Cube Sat Payload An Asteroid Mining Simulation Simulate Asteroid Surface Operations In addition to the projects I will also involve myself in organizations that can help me achieve my goals such as a Robotics Club, AIAA, RockSat, and CanSat.\nI will try to find research to perform for at least 1 semester. and I will try to get internships at NASA, JPL, and/ or APL.\nSkill I will master include Python, C/C++, ROS2, Cotrol Systems, CAD, FEA, GD+T, Thermal Modeling.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-first-post/","summary":"A summary of my goals over the next 5 years","title":"5 Year Goal Summary"},{"content":"Purpose This page is a minimal working demonstration of a browser-based economic model for asteroid mining as an input to space-based solar panel production.\nAt this stage, the model is intentionally simple.\nLayer One: Asteroid Resource Model This layer estimates the cost per kilogram of usable material delivered to cislunar space from a single asteroid mining mission.\nKey Assumptions Asteroid mass: 500,000 metric tons Accessible fraction: 20% Useful material fraction: 30% Extraction efficiency: 70% Baseline mission cost: $5 billion Delta-v (round trip): 6 km/s These values are deliberately conservative and intended to establish order-of-magnitude feasibility.\nInteractive Parameters Delta-v (km/s): 6\rExtraction efficiency: 0.70\rAccessible fraction: 0.20\rResult Computing cost...\r","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/asteroid-solar-economics/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"purpose\"\u003ePurpose\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis page is a minimal working demonstration of a browser-based\neconomic model for asteroid mining as an input to space-based\nsolar panel production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this stage, the model is intentionally simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"layer-one-asteroid-resource-model\"\u003eLayer One: Asteroid Resource Model\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis layer estimates the cost per kilogram of usable material delivered\nto cislunar space from a single asteroid mining mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"key-assumptions\"\u003eKey Assumptions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAsteroid mass: 500,000 metric tons\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAccessible fraction: 20%\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUseful material fraction: 30%\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExtraction efficiency: 70%\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBaseline mission cost: $5 billion\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDelta-v (round trip): 6 km/s\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese values are deliberately conservative and intended\nto establish order-of-magnitude feasibility.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Asteroid Mining Economics: A Minimal Model"}]
